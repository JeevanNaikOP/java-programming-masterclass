# Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers

Course by Tim Buchalka

### Project Naming conventions
I haven't followed the convention used by Tim for naming my projects; instead I have started the
 project name with a
 number and kept my names
 in small letters and separated words with a dash `-`, such as `26-digit-sum-challenge`. The
  number helps to order the projects logically with the course.

I have also tried to group the exercises together into single projects (rather than making each
   exercise a project) to save space and keep the total number of projects in the course to a
    minimum. A group of exercises' project will be named as `[number]-exercise-[from]-[to]`, for
     example `30-exercises-27-28`, which is project no. 30, exercises 27 to 28.
